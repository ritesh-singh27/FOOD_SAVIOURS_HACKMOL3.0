            Despite adequate food production, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation has reported that about 190
            million Indians remain undernourished. Moreover, it states that every third malnourished child is Indian.
            Ironically, the same report highlights that around 40% of the food produced in India is either lost or
            wasted. It is further estimated that the value of food wastage in India is around ₹92,000 crores per annum.
            There is also a significant amount of food waste generated in our homes. As per the Food Waste Index Report
            2021, a staggering 50 kg of food is thrown away per person every year in Indian homes.
            <br>
            <br>
            “Throwing away food is like stealing from the table of those who are poor and hungry” -Pope Francis
            <br>
            <br>
            One-third of the global food production is wasted every year. That’s four times what it would take to
            relieve undernutrition worldwide. If countries, including the United States, support and work toward the
            reduction of their food loss and waste, we could see huge improvements in global hunger. Our population is
            projected to reach 8.1 billion in 2025 with 95% of that growth in low and middle-income countries. While we
            are producing enough food to feed everyone, the poor practices in the food system are cause for massive food
            waste and thus contribute to global food insecurity.
